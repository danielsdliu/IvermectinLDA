# IvermectinLDA

Notebooks mostly describe what is contained.  Notebooks 3-4 were mostly used for development portion and are there mostly for the record.  The final model is in Notebook 5.  The LDA visualizations from the final model are contained in the folder.

You will need your own Twitter API key (ideally with research access) and MongoDB database to replicate parts 1 and 2.  For the remainder of the notebooks, the filesystem was edited to relative paths, but should still work.

The final model is uploaded in the LDA Model folder, you'll likely need to install gensim to load it though.
